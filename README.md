# 🚀 Discord Webhook Network 🚀
A basic batch script to send messages via a webhook using `curl`.

## Features ✨
- **Drag-and-Drop:** You can drag any file / media directly onto the script to send it to the webhook. 📤
- **Customization:** You can customize the app the way you want it! (Title, Color) 🖌️
- **Easy to use**: Enter your message and send it directly to your Webhook! 🗨️

## Setup ⚙️
1. **Download the latest release**: https://github.com/ItzBloxxy/Discord-Webhook-Messenger/releases 📥
2. **Configure the Webhook URL**: Open the script in a text editor and replace `set-your-webhook-here` with your actual Discord webhook URL. 🪝
3. Run the `DWN.bat` file. 🎯
4. Enter your message when prompted. 📝 (The message will be sent to directly to your Webhook!)

## Requirements 📋  
- **Compatibility**: Works only on Windows 7 through Windows 11. 🖥️
- **curl**: Ensure that `curl` is installed and available in your system's `PATH`. 🔧  

## Limitations 🚧  
- Due to batch file limitations, some features may not work as expected.  
- **Multi-line Input**: Typing text across multiple lines (e.g., pressing Enter between words) will not work:  

  ```
  Hello  
  World!  
  ```

## Recommendation 💡  
- It is recommended to use `curl` **8.10.1 or higher** to improve script performance, fix potential issues, and access new features.
